# 0x19-postmortem

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: February 13, 2024, 10:00 PM (UTC)
  - End Time: February 14, 2024, 2:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** 
  - The outage affected the authentication service, causing 80% of users to experience login failures and degraded performance.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was an unexpected surge in database connections, exceeding the configured limits due to a misconfiguration in the connection pooling settings.

**Timeline:**

- **10:00 PM (UTC):** 
  - Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in error rates for authentication requests.
- **10:05 PM (UTC):** 
  - Engineering team notified and investigation initiated.
- **10:15 PM (UTC):** 
  - Initial assumption: Database performance degradation due to increased load.
- **10:30 PM (UTC):** 
  - Database performance metrics analyzed, ruling out database issues.
- **11:00 PM (UTC):** 
  - Misleading investigation: Focus shifted towards network connectivity issues.
- **11:30 PM (UTC):** 
  - Escalation to database administrators and networking team for further analysis.
- **12:00 AM (UTC):** 
  - Root cause identified: Misconfigured connection pooling settings leading to excessive database connections.
- **1:00 AM (UTC):** 
  - Connection pooling settings adjusted to limit the number of concurrent connections.
- **2:00 AM (UTC):** 
  - Service restored, authentication requests processing normally.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The issue stemmed from misconfigured connection pooling settings, allowing an excessive number of concurrent connections to the database. This resulted in resource exhaustion and degraded performance of the authentication service.

To resolve the issue, the connection pooling settings were adjusted to impose limits on the number of simultaneous connections allowed, ensuring optimal utilization of database resources and preventing future instances of resource exhaustion.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

1. **Configuration Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of all connection pooling and database configuration settings to identify and rectify any misconfigurations.
2. **Automated Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring systems to provide early detection of abnormal database connection behavior, triggering alerts for immediate investigation.
3. **Load Testing:** Implement regular load testing procedures to simulate and analyze various traffic scenarios, ensuring the scalability and resilience of the authentication service under different loads.
4. **Documentation Update:** Document the root cause and resolution of the outage, including updated configuration settings and procedures to mitigate similar issues in the future.

**Tasks:**

1. Update connection pooling settings to enforce connection limits.
2. Review and optimize database resource allocation.
3. Implement additional automated monitoring for database connections.
4. Schedule regular load testing for the authentication service.
5. Document the incident details and lessons learned for future reference and training purposes.

By implementing these measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to enhance the stability and reliability of our authentication service, minimizing the risk of similar outages in the future.
